# KRNL-RWA-Trading
I created a decentralised platform on the Sapphire testnet for cross chain RWA trading. It includes a smart contract for user compliance, a NodeJS backend for KRNL integration, and a React frontend for trade initiation. Verified trade requests are processed via KRNL, allowing whitelisted users to execute transactions and track statuses in real time
